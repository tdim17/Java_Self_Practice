1. Create a class named ArrayElements and write a program with the following specifications:
   1.1 Create an array of integers with a length of 100.
   1.2 Assign values from 1 to 100 to the indexes of the array.
   1.3 Display the array elements in a single line separated by spaces.
   1.4 Display the array elements in a single line in reversed order, separated by spaces.
   1.5 Display all evenly divisible elements by 5 in a single line separated by spaces.



2. Create a class named ClassMatesInitials and write a program with the following specifications:
   2.1 Create an array of strings named classmates.
   2.2 Store full names of 10 classmates.
   2.3 Print the initials of each student's name in separate lines.



3. Create a class named EvenOddNumbers and write a program that counts the even and odd numbers from an array of integers.

			Example:
				array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

			Output: 
				The array has 4 odd numbers and 3 even numbers.



4. Create a class named StudentGrade and write a program with the following specifications:
	4.1 Given two arrays with the same length:
		   studentNames (String[])
		   scores (int[])

		int[] itemIDs =   {12345 ,     12346,  12347,    12348,     12349,    12350};

   5.2 Find the first index number of "Gloves".
   5.3 Check if "iPad" is contained in the item list.
   5.4 Print the report for each shopping item in the format: 
   				name - price - #ID



6. Create a class named ClassMatesReversed and write a program with the following specifications:
   6.1 Create an array of strings named classmates.
   6.2 Store full names of 10 classmates.
   6.3 Reverse each student's name and print them on separate lines.



7. Create a class named CommonElements and write a program that prints out the common elements from two integer arrays.

			Example:
				arr1: {1,2,3,4,5}
				arr2: {4,5,6,7,8}

			Output:
				4
				5



8. Create a class named ReverseArray and write a program to reverse an array of integers and return it as a new one.

			Example:
				array = {1,2,3,4,5};

			Output:
				reversedArray = {5,4,3,2,1};



9. Create a class named MoveTheZeros and write a program that can move all the zeros to the end of the array.

			Example:
				array = {10, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0};

			Output:
				{10, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0};



10. Create a class named GroceryItems and write a program with the following specifications:
    10.1 Given the following array:
         String[][] items = {
             {"Apple", "Banana", "Grape", "Avocado"},
             {"Paper Towels", "Toilet Papers", "Tissues", "Diapers"},
             {"Coke", "Fanta", "Arizona Tea", "Pepsi", "Water"}
         };

    10.2 Print the following output: (add \t between two words)
         Apple    Banana   Grape    Avocado
         Paper Towels     Toilet Papers   Tissues    Diapers
