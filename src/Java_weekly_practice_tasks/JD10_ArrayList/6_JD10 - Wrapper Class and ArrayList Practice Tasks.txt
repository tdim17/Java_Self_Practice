	        output:
	            true



3. Create a class called DuplicateElements and write a program with the following specifications:
   3.1 Given an ArrayList, duplicate each element in the list.

		 	Example:
                list = [1,2,3,4,5];

            output:
            	[1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5];



4. Create a class called CombineTwoArrays and write a program with the following specifications:
   4.1 Given two String arrays, combine them into one ArrayList.

                Example:
                    arr1 = {"A", "B", "C"};
                    arr2 = {"D", "E", "F", "G"};

                Output:
                    list ==> {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"}



5. Create a class called MoveTheZeros and write a program with the following specifications:
   5.1 Given an ArrayList, move all zeros to the last indexes of the ArrayList.

	            Example:
	                list: {1,0,2,0,3,0,4,0}

	            output:
	                [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]



6. Create a class called MultiplyOddNumbers and write a program with the following specifications:
   6.1 Given an ArrayList, multiply each odd number by 2.
				
				Example: 
					list = [1,2,3,4,5];

				output:
					[2,2,6,4,10]



7. Create a class called MaximumAndMinimumNumbers and write a program with the following specifications:
   7.1 Given an ArrayList of integers, find and display the maximum and minimum numbers without using any sorting.

			Example:
				list = [1,2,3,4,5];

			output:
			    Maximum number is 5
			    Minimum number is 1



8. Create a class called RemoveDuplicates and write a program with the following specifications:
   8.1 Given an ArrayList of integers, remove duplicated numbers.

			Example:
				list = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,6,7]

			Output:
				[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]



9. Create a class called UniqueElements and write a program with the following specifications:
   9.1 Given an ArrayList, display the unique elements without using any loops.

			Example:
				list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]

			output:
				[2, 4]



10. Create a class called RemoveLetters and write a program with the following steps:
    10.1 Given an ArrayList of characters, remove all the letters.

			Example:
				list = {'$', A', 'B', '1', '2', 'c', 'd', '@', '!', '3', '4'}

			output:
				['$',  '1', '2', '@', '!', '3', '4']



11. Create a class called SameFirstAndLast and write a program with the following specifications:
    11.1 Given an ArrayList of strings, remove elements if the first and last characters of the string are the same.

			Example:
				list = {"Anna", "Canada", "Bob", "David", "Lan", "Abida", "Ebrahim", "Farida"}

			output:
				["Canada", "Lan", "Ebrahim", "Farida"]
