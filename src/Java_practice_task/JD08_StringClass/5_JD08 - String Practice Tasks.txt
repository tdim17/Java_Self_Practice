1. Create a class named StartsWithX and write a program that asks the user to enter a word. 
If the word starts with 'x,' replace it with 'a'.

        Example:
              Input:
                 xcodex

              Output:
                 acodex


2. Create a class named WithoutFirstChar. Ask the user to enter two words. Print the first word without its
first character, then print the second word without its first character.

        Example:
              Inputs:
                  apple
                  banana

              Output:
                   ppleanana


3. Create a class named CombineWords. Ask the user to enter two words. Then, add them together and print. But if the
last letter of the first word and the first letter of the second word are the same, print that character once.

        Example:
              Input:
                 one
                 eight

              Output:
                   oneight


4. Create a class called EmailTask1. Assume that the email address is constructed by a person's first name followed
by an underscore and last name. Write a program that can swap the first name with the last name in the email 
(separated by an underscore). If the email doesn't contain an underscore, print the given input email.

        Example:
              Input:
                 mike_tyson@gmail.com

              Output:
                  tyson_mike@gmail.com


5. Create a class called EmailTask2. Assume that the email address is constructed by a person's first name followed 
by an underscore and last name. Write a program that will print out information about the user based on the email. 
Print the first name, last name, and domain. First and last names should be printed with the proper format.
(uppercase first letter and remaining lowercase)

        Example:
              Input:
                 craig_federighi@apple.com

              Output:
                   First name: Craig
                   Last name: Federighi
                   Domain: apple


6. Write a program that asks the user to enter first and last names and then prints the full name in regular format 
(first character in uppercase).

        Example:
              Input:
                  firstName = "cyDEo";
                  lastName = "SCHOOL";

              Output:
                   Cydeo School


7. Create a class called TipCalculator and write a program for a tip calculator. There will be different service 
quality benchmarks that will determine the tip given. There will also be the ability to calculate based on the 
number of people in the party and whether there is a split of the bill.

        Poor = 5%, Fair = 10%, Good = 15%, Great = 20%, Excellent = 25%

      The program should ask the user to enter:
          - Split or No split (Yes or No),
          - Enter the number of people (number)
          - Enter the check amount (number)
          - Service Quality (String)

      And display the output in the following format:

            Example:
                  Split or No Split (Yes or No)?
                  Input: Yes
                  Enter the number of people:
                  Input: 4
                  Enter the check amount:
                  Input: 476
                  How was the service quality? (Excellent/Great/Good/Fair/Poor)
                  Input: Excellent

            Output:
                 Number of people entered: 4
                 Total to pay: 595.0
                 Total tip: 119.0
                 Total per person: 148.75
                 Tip per person: 29.75
