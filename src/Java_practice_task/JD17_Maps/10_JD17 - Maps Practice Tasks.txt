1. Create a class named MultiplyOdds and write a program that takes a map with characters as keys
and integers as values. The program will iterate through the map and, for each entry where the value
is an odd number, it will multiply this value by two.

         Example:
               map = {'a'=1, 'b'=2, 'c'=3, 'd'=4, 'e'=5}

         Output:
            {'a'=2, 'b'=2, 'c'=6, 'd'=4, 'e'=10}


2. Create a class named InvertMap and write a program that returns a new map which is the 
inverted version of the provided map, meaning the keys become values and the values become keys.
It is assumed that there are no duplicate values in the original map.

         Example:
               map = {1="a", 2="b", 3="c"}

         Output:
               {"a"=1, "b"=2, "c"=3}


3. Create a class named MergeMaps and write a program that merge two given maps.
If a key is present in both maps, add their corresponding values together.

         Example:
               map1 = {'A'=10, 'B'=20}
               map2 = {'B'=30, 'C'=40}

         Output:
               {'A'=10, 'B'=50, 'C'=40}


4. Create a class named FrequencyOfCharacters and write a program that returns the frequency of each 
character in a given string as a map, without using nested loops.
         Example:
               string = "bbcccaaaaa"

         Output:
               {b=2, c=3, a=5}


5. Create a class named UniqueCharacters and write a program that returns the unique characters from a given
string as a map, with each character's frequency as the value. This should be done without using nested loops.

         Example:
               string = "aabcccdeeeef"

         Output:
               {b=1, d=1, f=1}
